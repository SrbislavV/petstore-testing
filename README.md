Open a command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the root directory of Cypress project.<br>
Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running the following command:<br>
```
  node --version
```
If Node.js is not installed, you can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org<br>
Install the project dependencies by running the following command:<br>
```
  npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Cypress tests by executing one of the following commands:<br>
```
  npx cypress open
```
This command launches the Cypress Test Runner interface, allowing you to select and execute the tests interactively.<br>
OR<br>
```
  npx cypress run
```
This command runs the Cypress tests in headless mode, without launching the Test Runner interface.<br>
